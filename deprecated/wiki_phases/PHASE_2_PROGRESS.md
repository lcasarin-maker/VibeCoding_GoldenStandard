# Phase 2 Progress — Consolidate Rules + Populate Stubs

**Start Date:** 2026-06-02 | **Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS

---

## COMPLETED (This Session)

### ✅ Rules Migrated to GS

| Rule | Source | Target | Status |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Dual-Session Awareness | GEMINI.md | LEVEL_2/M5 | ✅ DONE |
| Pre-Destructive Checklist | AGENT.md + GEMINI.md | LEVEL_4/M1 | ✅ DONE |
| No Silent Changes | GEMINI.md | LEVEL_4/M1 | ✅ DONE |
| Pure Replacement (VC-118) | AGENT.md + GS | LEVEL_4/M1 | ✅ INTEGRATED |
| Hard Stops (Prohibitions) | PROTOCOL_SYSTEM.md | LEVEL_4/M1 | ✅ INTEGRATED |

**Key Achievement:** 3 critical principles now live in GS, not trapped in agent-specific files.

---

## PENDING (Next Steps)

### 🔴 CRITICAL

- [ ] **Clarify S1-S9 scope:** Are S1-S9 mandates in PROTOCOL_SYSTEM.md universal?
  - If YES → Migrate from PROTOCOL_SYSTEM.md to GS/Principles (LEVEL_2, LEVEL_4, etc.)
  - If NO → Document why they exist in both places
  - Action: Compare PROTOCOL_SYSTEM.md vs CLAUDE.md line-by-line

- [ ] **Incident Case Study in LEVEL_1/M1:**
  - Migrate 2026-05-17 revert incident from GEMINI.md to GS
  - Frame as: "Extract value from failures and register as doctrine" (CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT)
  - Action: Write M1_Core_Principles.md with incident example

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY

- [ ] **Populate 32 stubs** from deprecated/ sources:
  - VC-001..123 from AI_Coding_Anti_Patterns_Library.md (14 files)
  - VT-001..115 from TESTING_EVALUATION_VICES_LIBRARY.md (3 files)
  - TK-001..030 from TOKENOMICS_CONTEXT_LIBRARY.md (3 files, TK renumbered)
  - Principles modules from N_MODULOS/ (12 files)

- [ ] **Update CORRELATION_MATRIX.md:**
  - Reflect TK renumbering (F01-F03 → 001-003)
  - Update references to category files (once populated)
  - Validate cross-links

### 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY

- [ ] **ChatGPT/CodeX instructions:** Reference GS instead of deprecated/
- [ ] **DEDUP_LOG.yaml:** Update TK consolidation notes
- [ ] **Create deprecation notice** in deprecated/Golden_Standard/ → redirect to active GS

## Files Modified This Session

| File | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| LEVEL_2_Operation/M5_Audit_Git.md | Populated with Dual-Session + Session Closure rules | ✅ Active |
| LEVEL_4_Guards/M1_Prohibitions.md | Populated with hard stops + incident case study | ✅ Active |
| Tasks #4, #5, #6 | Created for Phase 2 coordination | ✅ Tracking |

---

## Next Session Checklist

Before continuing Phase 2:

1. [ ] Decide S1-S9 fate (universal or keep separated?)
2. [ ] Start population of 32 stubs (prioritize Patterns first, then Principles)
3. [ ] Update CORRELATION_MATRIX.md with TK changes
4. [ ] Run SCOPE_AUDIT.md final checklist

---

## Metrics

| Metric | Phase 1 | Phase 2 Target | Current |
|--------|---------|----------------|---------|
| Stubs created | 32 | ✅ 32 | 32 |
| Stubs populated | 0 | Target: 32 | 2 (M5, M1) |
| Rules consolidated | 0 | Target: 10+ | 5 consolidated |
| Universal rules in GS | 0 | Target: S1-S9 + others | Partial |
| HISTORIAL.md integrated | No | Yes | ✅ In M5 |

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **S1-S9 Mandate:** "1:1 Parity Mandatory" (PROTOCOL_SYSTEM.md) = universal
   - TODO: Confirm this and migrate from PROTOCOL_SYSTEM.md to GS

2. **HISTORIAL.md Authority:** Single source of truth for all agent work
   - Formalizes requirement to document at session close
   - Prevents "silent changes" incidents

3. **Pre-Destructive Checklist:** DOUBLE-KEY RULE = human approval required
   - Prevents incidents like 2026-05-17 Gemini revert
   - Applies to ALL agents (universal, not Gemini-specific)

---

## Remaining Work Estimate

- **Population of 32 stubs:** 4-6 hours (depends on deprecated/ content quality)
- **S1-S9 migration:** 2-3 hours (research + migration)
- **CORRELATION_MATRIX update:** 1 hour
- **Validation + cleanup:** 1-2 hours

**Total Phase 2:** ~8-12 hours of focused work
