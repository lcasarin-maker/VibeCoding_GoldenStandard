# Ingestion Protocol — Golden Standard

> The canonical, executable guide for promoting a finding from the Inbox into the Golden Standard catalog.

## Overview

The Ingestion Protocol is the **quality gate** between raw observations and codified knowledge.
Its job is to ensure that only well-formed, deduplicated, actionable knowledge enters the catalog.

Unconfirmed observations are hypotheses, not facts. Keep them in the intake lane
until they have enough evidence to become durable knowledge.

If a hypothesis can be tested with today's work, test it now instead of leaving
it as a speculative note.

```

## Who Runs This

The **curator** — either the DRI (human) or an AI agent acting as curator — is responsible
for executing this protocol. The curator must have read access to all YAML catalogs and write
access to the repository.

---

## Step 1 — Validate the Finding

Open the file in `Inbox/<source>/` and verify it contains at minimum:

- [ ] `source` — matches a canonical name in `KNOWLEDGE_SOURCES.md`
- [ ] `date_detected` — valid ISO 8601 date
- [ ] `symptom` — concrete, observable behavior
- [ ] `cause` — root cause, not just the symptom restated
- [ ] `proposed_domain` — one of: `VC`, `VT`, `TK`, `PI`
- [ ] `proposed_severity` — one of: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`
- [ ] `mitigation_proposal` — at least one actionable prevention step
- [ ] `origin` — exact locus of the observation (`path:line`, `catalog:id`, or equivalent stable source)
- [ ] If the finding is about a missing tool, scanner, or hook, `mitigation_proposal` states the manual install/recovery step and the blocked capability.

If any required field is missing: **return the finding to the source** with a note.
Do not proceed.

---

## Step 2 — Deduplicate

Search the existing catalogs for the pattern described:

```bash
# Quick scan of coding vices
grep -i "<keyword>" golden_standard_coding_vices.yaml

# Quick scan of testing vices
grep -i "<keyword>" golden_standard_testing_vices.yaml
```

**If an existing entry covers the finding:**
- If the finding adds new evidence or nuance → update the existing entry's `evidence_notes` field
- If the finding is a duplicate with no new information → discard, move to `deprecated/`
- In both cases, note the existing entry ID in the Inbox file before closing

If the finding is still a hypothesis, keep it in `Inbox/` or an analysis note
until it is confirmed 3+ times or otherwise supported by strong evidence.

**If no existing entry covers the finding:**
- Proceed to Step 3

---

## Step 3 — Map to Domain and Assign ID

### Determine the Domain

| Domain | Code | Catalog file | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vibe Coding Vice | `VC` | `golden_standard_coding_vices.yaml` | AI-assisted dev antipatterns |
| Testing Vice | `VT` | `golden_standard_testing_vices.yaml` | Test quality failures |
| Tokenomics | `TK` | `golden_standard_tokenomics.yaml` | AI token usage inefficiencies |
| Principle | `PR` | `golden_standard_principles.yaml` | Cross-cutting doctrine/lessons |
| Structure Principle | `SP` | `golden_standard_structure_principles.yaml` | Architectural/structural doctrine |
| Adversarial Vector | `AV` | `golden_standard_adversarial_vectors.yaml` | Attack/failure-injection scenarios |

### Assign the Next Sequential ID

Open the target YAML file and find the last entry. Increment by 1.

```bash
# Find the last ID in the coding vices catalog
grep "^- id:" golden_standard_coding_vices.yaml | tail -1
```

Record the new ID (e.g., `VC-701`).

---

## Step 4 — Add the YAML Entry

Open the target catalog file and append the new entry in canonical format:

```yaml
- id: VC-701                          # Assigned in Step 3
  title: "Short descriptive title"
  symptom: |
    What you observe when this vice is present.
  cause: |
    Root cause or mechanism.
  solution: |
    What to do instead.
  status: DOC_ONLY                    # DOC_ONLY | PREVENTED | REMEDIATED
  severity: high                      # critical | high | medium | low
  tags:
    - vibe-coding                    # at least two normalized slugs
    - ai-native
  action: |
    The corrective/preventive action; where enforcement lives, if any.
  validating_mechanism: DOC_ONLY     # static-ast | static-regex | runtime-test | external-tool | DOC_ONLY | doctrinal
  downstream_verification: required   # required | none
  tier: core                          # core | specialist
  # --- Depth fields (for falsifiable entries) ---
  example_lang: python
  example_bad: |
    # Concrete code that triggers the vice.
  example_good: |
    # The corrected version.
  detection: |
    A concrete, falsifiable detection recipe (AST/regex/heuristic, or the
    external tool that catches it). Name a tool only if it really exists.
  evidence:
    - source: "arxiv:XXXX.XXXXX"
      claim: "What that source actually shows."
  # detector: vc701_my_check        # OPTIONAL: add to scripts/detectors.py if statically checkable
  # --- OR, for doctrinal entries (no static signature) ---
  # doctrinal: true
```

Save the file.

---

## Step 5 — Create the Wiki Article

Create a new Markdown file at:
```
Wiki/Vices/<ID>.md
```

Use this template:

```markdown
# <ID> — <Title>

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **ID** | `<ID>` |
| **Category** | Vibe Coding / Testing / Tokenomics |
| **Status** | **<status>** |
| **Severity** | **<severity>** |
| **Depth** | 🟢 Deep / ⚪ Doctrinal |
| **Tags** | `<tag1>`, `<tag2>` |
| **Downstream Verification** | `required` / `none` |
| **Validation Mechanism** | `<mechanism>` |

---

### Symptom
> <What you observe>

### Cause
<Root cause>

### Solution
<What to do instead>

### Corrective Action / Prevention
<The action from the YAML>

### ❌ Example of the vice (Bad)
```<lang>
# <example_bad>
```

### ✅ Corrected version (Good)
```<lang>
# <example_good>
```

### 🔎 Concrete detection
<Detection recipe>

### 📚 External evidence
- **<source>** — <claim>

### Relations
- [[Project_Insights/PI-019|PI-019]]
- [[Tokenomics_Map|Tokenomics Map]]
- [[Home|Home]]

---
[[Vices_Index|Back to Vices Index]] | [[Home|Home]]
```

For a doctrinal entry (no static signature), omit the example and detection sections and mark **Depth** as `⚪ Doctrinal`.

---

## Step 6 — Run the Audit Script

```bash
python generate_golden_audit.py
```

Verify:
- [ ] The new entry appears in the audit output
- [ ] The Wiki article is detected and linked
- [ ] No errors in YAML parsing

---

## Step 7 — Close the Finding

1. Add a closing note to the Inbox file:
   ```
   ## Resolution
   Promoted to: <ID> (<YAML file>)
   Wiki article: Wiki/Vices/<ID>.md
   Date promoted: YYYY-MM-DD
   Curator: <name or agent>
   ```
2. Move the Inbox file to `deprecated/`:
   ```bash
   git mv Inbox/<source>/<filename>.md deprecated/<filename>.md
   ```
3. Commit with message:
   ```
   knowledge: promote <ID> from Inbox
   
   Source: <source>
   Finding: <slug>
   Domain: <VC|VT|TK|PI>
   ```

---

## File Naming Conventions

| Location | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `Inbox/cerberus/` | `YYYY-MM-DD_<slug>.md` | `2026-06-04_silent-auth-bypass.md` |
| `Inbox/manual/` | `YYYY-MM-DD_<slug>.md` | `2026-06-05_ghost-service-layer.md` |
| `Inbox/external/` | `YYYY-MM-DD_gh<issue>_<slug>.md` | `2026-07-01_gh42_react-closure.md` |

---

## Commit Convention

All knowledge commits follow this format:

```
knowledge: <action> <ID>

<Optional body explaining rationale>

Source: <canonical source name>
```

Actions:
- `promote` — new entry from Inbox
- `refine` — update to existing entry
- `deprecate` — entry marked as superseded
- `elevate` — status progression (KNOWLEDGE → RULE_DEFINED → etc.)
